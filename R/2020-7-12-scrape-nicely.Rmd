```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE,include=FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(here)
library(png)
library(grid)

github <- rasterGrob(readPNG(here("images","GitHub-Mark","PNG","GitHub-Mark-64px.png")))
```

In exchange for free data at fbref or on their site, Statsbomb politely ask you to credit your work, using the logos available [here](https://statsbomb.com/media-pack/).

In ggplot you can add a text caption easily, but an image is a more complicated.

```{r caption}
plots <- list()
plots$p1 <-
  mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=cyl,y=hp)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  expand_limits(x=c(2,10),y=c(0,400)) +
  annotation_custom(github, xmin=8, xmax=10, ymin=300, ymax=400)

plots$p2 <-
  mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=mpg,y=disp)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  expand_limits(x=c(8),y=c(0,500)) +
  annotation_custom(github, xmin=8, xmax=10, ymin=300, ymax=400)

grid1 <- plot_grid(plots$p1, plots$p2)
grid1
```

The Cowplot package will do this for you. Other data sources are available and you can use this for any logo, including your own if you like.

# Method

1. Save your ggplots in a list. This is good practice for lots of reasons.

plots$mtcars <- ggplot()

1. Install Cowplot and create a function like this.
You can hard-code the file name and coordinates or take them in as arguments.

1. Call the function with your list of ggplots.

Please scrape responsibly.
