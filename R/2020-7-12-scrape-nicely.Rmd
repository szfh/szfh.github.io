```{r setup}
library(cowplot)
library(here)\
```

In exchange for free data at fbref or on their site, Statsbomb politely ask you to use their logo, available [here](https://statsbomb.com/media-pack/).

In ggplot you can add a text caption easily, but an image is surprisingly complicated.



The Cowplot package will do this for you. Other data sources are available and you can use this for any logo, including your own if you like.

# Method

1. Save your ggplots in a list. This is good practice for lots of reasons.

plots$mtcars <- ggplot()

1. Install Cowplot and create a function like this.
You can hard-code the file name and coordinates or take them in as arguments.

1. Call the function with your list of ggplots.
