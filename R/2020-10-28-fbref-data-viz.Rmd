Using the [acciotables](https://github.com/npranav10/acciotables/) API, and some minor data transformation in R, it's possible to get Statsbomb/FBRef expected goals data for every EPL match since 2017-18.

This standalone script will produce a dataset and visualisation to use as a starting point for more detailed analysis and graphics. You don't need your own data, just an installation of R and RStudio.

## Getting data with the acciotables API

FBref stores a summary of all 380 matches in a [single html table](https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/3232/schedule). We just need the `page_url` and `selector_id`, and acciotables will produce the data in a nice html format.

Looking in the page source gives the `selector_id`: **%23sched_ks_3232_1**

```{r data, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
page_url <- "https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/3232/schedule/"
selector_id <- "%23sched_ks_3232_1"
url <- paste0("http://acciotables.herokuapp.com/?page_url=",page_url,"&content_selector_id=",selector_id)

cat(paste0("API url: ",url))
```

Check the API is working in your [browser](`r url`).

## Importing into R

There's a guide in the [acciotables readme](https://github.com/npranav10/acciotables/#-calling-the-api-in-r).

```{r import, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
matches_import <- url %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_table() %>%
  extract2(1) # unnest the data_frame from the list

head(matches_import)
# print(head(matches))
# format(head(matches_import))
# gt(head(matches))
```

## Tidy the data

There's a few things to sort out to make the raw data more usable.

* There are two columns called `xG`. That is definitely going to make something go wrong.

```{r fix-names}
names(matches_import) <-
  names(matches_import) %>%
  make.unique(sep="_")

matches_tidy1 <-
  matches_import %>%
  rename("HomexG"="xG","AwayxG"="xG_1")

cat(names(matches_tidy1))

gt(head(matches_tidy1))
```

* The dataset has some non-data lines. There should be 380 lines of data, one for each match in the season.

```{r non-data}
matches_tidy2 <-
  matches_tidy1 %>%
  filter(Wk!="Wk",Wk!="")

cat(paste0("rows: ",dim(matches_tidy2)[1],"\n","columns: ",dim(matches_tidy2)[2]))
```

* Don't care about the attendance, referee etc.

```{r delete-cols}
matches_tidy3 <-
  matches_tidy2 %>%
  select(-c("Attendance":"Notes"))

gt(head(matches_tidy3))
```

* The `Score` column looks something like **4-1**. We want two columns: home goals and away goals.

```{r separate}
matches_tidy4 <-
  matches_tidy3 %>%
  separate("Score",c("HomeGls","AwayGls"),sep="[:punct:]",fill="right")

gt(head(matches_tidy4))
```

* All the data has the *character* datatype, so a simple line will auto-detect which ones should be numeric, date etc.

```{r type}
matches_tidy5 <-
  matches_tidy4 %>%
  type_convert()

gt(head(matches_tidy5))
```

This is much easier to work with, but there's one more change that will help a lot later.

## Transform into long data

[Tidy data has one observation per row](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html#tidy-data). Each line in this table has two independent(ish) observations: *home score* and *away score*. By transforming to long (as opposed to wide) format, working with the data becomes much easier.

What's happening here is:

* A pivot_longer implementation to separate home and away
* The original `matches` data frame joined back to the new data - a bit of a trick to get sort of metadata, for filtering or labelling. Don't worry too much about this if it doesn't make sense.
* Then if_else to sort out the rest of the home/away data.
* The columns used in the final plot are relocated to the left to make it easier to see.

That's all in a function called `make_long_matches` for good practice.

```{r}
make_long_matches <- function(matches){
  
  long_matches <-
    matches %>%
    pivot_longer(cols=c(Home,Away),
                 names_to="HA",
                 values_to="Squad") %>%
    left_join(matches) %>% # join the old data frame to the new one
    mutate(
      Opposition=ifelse(HA=="Home",Away,Home),
      GlsF=ifelse(HA=="Home",HomeGls,AwayGls),
      GlsA=ifelse(HA=="Home",AwayGls,HomeGls),
      xGF=ifelse(HA=="Home",HomexG,AwayxG),
      xGA=ifelse(HA=="Home",AwayxG,HomexG)
    ) %>%
    relocate("Squad","Opposition":"xGA","HA")
  
  return(long_matches)
}

matches_long <- make_long_matches(matches_tidy5)

gt(head(matches_long))

cat(paste0("rows: ",dim(matches_long)[1],"\n","columns: ",dim(matches_long)[2]))
```

Now there are 760 rows, one for each team in each match.

## Filter

Next the data can be filtered get a subset for analysis. In this case it's the data for all matches played so far by a single team.

```{r}
team_name <- "Liverpool"

matches_team <-
  matches_long %>%
  filter(Squad==team_name) %>% # filter team
  filter(!is.na(HomeGls)) # only matches which have been played
```

Some work to use later - create an new column to use as an X axis label, and use `fct_reorder` to get the X axis in date order.

```{r}
matches_team <-
  matches_team %>%
  mutate(Match=paste0(Opposition," ",HA," ",GlsF,"-",GlsA)) %>% # make X axis labels
  mutate(Match=fct_reorder(Match, Date)) # order by date
```

## Plot

Lots of ways to do this, here's a ggplot with some lines, some points, a theme, and some slightly better labels made with ggtext.

```{r plot, eval=FALSE}
matches_team %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Match,group=1)) +
  geom_point(aes(y=xGF),size=2,colour="black",fill="darkred",shape=21) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y=xGF),colour="darkred",se=FALSE) +
  geom_point(aes(y=xGA),size=2,colour="black",fill="royalblue",shape=21) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y=xGA),colour="royalblue",se=FALSE) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    plot.title=element_markdown(),
    axis.title.y=element_markdown(),
    axis.text.x=element_text(size=6,angle=60,hjust=1)
  ) +
  labs(
    title=paste0(team_name," <b style='color:darkred'>attack</b> / <b style='color:royalblue'>defence</b> xG trend"),
    x=element_blank(),
    y=("Expected goals <b style='color:darkred'>for</b> / <b style='color:royalblue'>against</b>")
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand=expansion(add=c(0.5))) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,NA),expand=expansion(add=c(0,0.1)))
```
