## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

![plot of chunk pressure]({{site.baseurl}}/images/markdown-test/pressure-1.png)

<center>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/2020-1-1-template/pressure-1.png" width="80%">  
</center>  

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
