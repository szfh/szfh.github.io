> Is Pierre-Emile Højbjerg good? Three things:

## Where he fits
He has appeared in a double-pivot with James Ward-Prowse, where neither tends to play particularly further forward than the other. Hojbjerg gets significantly more on-ball time than Ward-Prowse and completes riskier, more progressive actions.

There is good progressive passing volume but that doesn't always translate into the most dangerous passes - into the penalty area.

> something

**Sign this player if you want**  
more passing and ball progression in your midfield  
*and*  
something

**Don't sign this player if you want**  
a Kante/Ndidi/Fernandinho that lets you get five attacking players on the pitch  
*or*  
a player to put all your centre-of-the-pitch creation through.

(if you want both of those together, you need to rethink your targets)

>This is less of that, but maybe the fourth one of those doesn't exist.

## He should stop shooting, but that's fixable.
This is bad decision making, not bad shooting.

## He's taken impressive risks to get to where he is
He's played six 1200+ minute PL/Bundesliga seasons.
