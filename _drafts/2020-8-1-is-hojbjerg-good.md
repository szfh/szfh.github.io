> Is Pierre-Emile Højbjerg good? Three things:

## Where he fits
He has appeared in a double-pivot with James Ward-Prowse, where neither tends to play particularly further forward than the other. Defensive contributions are similar, but Hojbjerg gets significantly more on-ball time than Ward-Prowse and completes more risky, progressive actions.

There is good progressive passing volume but that doesn't always translate into the most dangerous passes - into the penalty area.

### Sign this player if you want
more passing and ball progression in your midfield  
	*and*  
consistently solid defensive output

### Don't sign this player if you want
a Kante/Ndidi/Fernandinho that lets you get five attacking players on the pitch  
	*or*  
a player to put all your centre-of-the-pitch creation through

>This is less of that, but maybe the fourth one of those doesn't exist.

## He should stop shooting, but that's fixable.
This is bad decision making, not bad shooting.

## He's taken impressive risks to get to where he is
He's played six 1200+ minute PL/Bundesliga seasons.
