Is Hojbjerg good? Three things:

## Position
He appears in a double-pivot with James Ward-Prowse, where neither tends to play particularly further forward than the other. Hojbjerg gets significantly more on-ball time than Ward-Prowse and completes riskier, more progressive actions.

There is good progressive passing volume but that doesn't always translate into the most dangerous passes - into the penalty area.

Sign this player if you want:
More passing and ball progression in your midfield
AND

Don't sign this player if you want:
A Kante/Ndidi/Fernandinho that lets you get five attacking players on the pitch? This is less of that, but maybe the fourth one of those doesn't exist.
OR
a player to put all your centre-of-the-pitch creation through.

You'll be looking for a long time to find both of those by the way.

## He should stop shooting, but that's fixable.
This is bad decision making, not bad shooting.

## He's taken impressive risks to get to where he is
He's played six 1200+ minute PL/Bundesliga seasons.
