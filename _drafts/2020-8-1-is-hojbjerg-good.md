> Is Pierre-Emile Højbjerg good? Three things:

## Where he fits.
He has appeared in a double-pivot with James Ward-Prowse, where neither tends to play particularly further forward than the other.

This is not Ralph Hasenhüttl's first line of defence so off-ball contributions are similar. But Hojbjerg gets significantly more on-ball time than Ward-Prowse and completes **higher risk actions**, maximising his range of passing.

There is good enough shot assist volume compared to similar mid-table players, particularly of the most dangerous type of pass: **into the opposition penalty area**.

## He should stop shooting, but that's fixable.

This is bad decision making, not bad shooting. Højbjerg has the skill to do even better by not hitting a long shot in most matches.

## He's taken impressive risks to get this transfer.

Superstars excepted, it's unusual to play 10,000 top 5 league minutes + 20 internationals across before age 25. But having joined a Europa League Southampton in 2016, he's entitled to feel like this leg of his career could have gone a little better.

Nonetheless it takes ambition to make a transfer knowing that easier options might be on the table.  Now he is positioned for his peak age contract, he can join a club which knows it wants a good midfielder, but not *exactly* sure what they want him to do.


## Sign this player if you want

* more passing and ball progression in your middle third  
	*and*  
* consistently solid defensive output
	*and*
* you're not really sure about your manager

## Don't sign this player if you want

* the next Kante/Ndidi/Fernandinho that lets you get five attacking players on the pitch  
	*or*  
* one player to put all your centre-of-the-pitch creation through
	*or*
* you're trying to build some specific play style
