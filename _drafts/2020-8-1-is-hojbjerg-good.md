> Is Pierre-Emile Højbjerg good? Three things:

## Where he fits.
He has appeared in a double-pivot with James Ward-Prowse, where neither tends to play particularly further forward than the other.

This is not Ralph Hasenhüttl's first line of defence so off-ball contributions are similar. But Hojbjerg gets significantly more on-ball time than Ward-Prowse and completes **higher risk actions**, maximising his range of passing.

There is good enough shot assist volume compared to similar mid-table players, particularly of the most dangerous type of pass: **into the opposition penalty area**.

#### Sign this player if you want
more passing and ball progression in your middle third  
	*and*  
consistently solid defensive output

#### Don't sign this player if you want
the next Kante/Ndidi/Fernandinho that lets you get five attacking players on the pitch  
	*or*  
one player to put all your centre-of-the-pitch creation through

## He should stop shooting, but that's fixable.

This is bad decision making, not bad shooting.

## He's taken impressive risks to get to where he is.
He's played six 1200+ minute PL/Bundesliga seasons
