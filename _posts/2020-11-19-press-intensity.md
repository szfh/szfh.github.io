fbref have added opposition stats to their summary pages for the 2020-21 season. That opens up a world of new analysis.

I am interested in alternative ways to look at Passes per Defensive Action - a commonly used measurement of pressing. Here I have calculated **Press Intensity** as **Opposition Touches** per **Pressure**. The pitch is split into thirds to show press style in different parts of the field (and because that is what fbref gives me). I have used touches instead of passes because it's more intuitive that an individual posssession would be pressured (or not). The difference is marginal.
