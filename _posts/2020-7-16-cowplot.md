If you use freely available data in your work, it's polite to give credit. You can do this with a text caption or by placing a logo inside your image.

In ggplot you can add a text caption easily, but an image is a more complicated.


```r
annotation_custom(github, xmin=8, xmax=10, ymin=300, ymax=400)
```


![annotation-1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/scrape-nicely/annotation-1.png)
*Placing a logo using plot coordinates can be painful.*

The Cowplot package will do this better by placing an image in the same relative position.

## Using Cowplot

1. Install Cowplot and create a function like this.  
You can hard-code the file name and coordinates to the function or take them in as arguments.


```r
add_logo <- function(plots,image_path){
  plots_logo <- list()
  
  for(i in 1:length(plots)){
    name <- names(plots[i])
    plots_logo[[name]] <-
      plots[[i]] %>%
      ggdraw() +
      draw_image(image_path,
                 x=0.95,
                 y=0.95,
                 hjust=1,
                 vjust=1,
                 width=0.12,
                 height=0.12)
  }
  return(plots_logo)
}
```



1. Call the function with your list of ggplots.

![grid-1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/scrape-nicely/draw-image-1.png)

*Adding a logo with Cowplot will place it neatly where you want.*
