Ralph Hasenhüttl put a lot into the cups in 2021, giving the first team four extra matches to play, resulting in nine midweek matches after January.

Except [Burnley](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/56553199) which was eight days after the [Bournemouth QF](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/56460519), three of those were followed by defeats, either in tired or tactically simple ways. The [Tottenham match](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/56383512) three days after the [Leicester defeat](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/56725449) was both: a strong start against a new manager visibly trailed off before half time, and half a day of training ground preparation wasn't enough for Ralph to plan anything useful with his subs.



Tom Leach showed that the worst run of results was during the cup run period where the fixture list was completely packed. Equally the results in the first half of the season came when Southampton were one of few PL teams not in the EFL Cup or Europe. That illustrates the price of those extra matches on Hasenhüttl's match intensity and shallow squad.

A cup run can seem appealing in January when the team is safe. But without depth it still costs league performances and points. The [prize money isn't worth it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_FA_Cup#Prize_fund), and all that is left is hoping the [draws go in your favour](https://twitter.com/saintsbynumbers/status/1373392734493544450) enough to win six matches (they won four). Next season, when Southampton aren't 6th in January, those above Ralph probably won't see the justification.
